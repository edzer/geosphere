_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Mid-point between two points along a great circle

_U_s_a_g_e:

     midPoint(p1, p2)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      p1: longitude/latitude of point(s); can be a vector of two
          numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude,
          second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object

      p2: as above. Should be of same length of p1, or a single point
          (or vice versa when p1 is a single point

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Just as the initial bearing may vary from the final bearing, the
     midpoint may not be located half-way between latitudes/longitudes;
     the midpoint between 35N,45E and 35N,135E is around 45N,90E.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A pair of coordinates (longitude/latitude)
