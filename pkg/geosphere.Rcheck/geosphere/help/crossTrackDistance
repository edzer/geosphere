_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The cross track distance (or cross track error) is the distance of
     a point from a great-circle path. The great circle path is defined
     by 'p1' and 'p2', while 'p3' is the point away from the path.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     crossTrackDistance(p1, p2, p3, r=6378137)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      p1: Start of great circle path. Longitude/latitude of point(s);
          can be a vector of two numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first
          one is longitude, second is latitude) or a spatialPoints*
          object

      p2: End of great circle path. As above. Should have same length
          as p1, or a single point (or vice versa when p1 is a single
          point

      p3: Point away from the great cricle path. As for p2

       r: radius of the earth; default = 6378137

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A distance in units of 'r' (default is meters)

     The sign indicates which side of the path p3 is on. Positive 
     means right of the course from p1 to p2, negative means left.
