_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The shortest distance between two points (i.e., the
     'great-circle-distance' or 'as the crow flies'), according to the
     'haversine method'. This method assumes a spherical earth,
     ignoring ellipsoidal effects.

     distHaversine(p1, p2, r=6378137)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      p1: longitude/latitude of point(s); can be a vector of two
          numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude,
          second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object

      p2: as above. Should have same length as p1, or a single point
          (or vice versa when p1 is a single point

       r: radius of the earth; default = 6378137 m

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The Haversine ('half-versed-sine') formula 'remains particularly
     well-conditioned for numerical computation even at small
     distances' - unlike calculations based on the spherical law of
     cosines. It was published by r.W. Sinnott in 1984, although it has
     been known  for much longer. When Sinnott devised the Haversine
     formula, computational precision was limited. Nowadays, computers
     can use 15 significant figures of precision. With this precision,
     the simple spherical law of cosines formula gives good results
     down to distances as small as around 1 meter. In view of this it
     is probably worth, in most situations, using either the simpler
     law of cosines or the more accurate ellipsoidal 'distVincenty'
     formula in preference to haversine! 

     Since the earth is not quite a sphere, there are small errors in
     using spherical geometry; the earth is actually roughly
     ellipsoidal (or more precisely, oblate spheroidal) with a radius
     varying between about 6378km (equatorial) and 6357km (polar), and
     local radius of curvature varying from 6336km (equatorial
     meridian) to 6399 km (polar). This means that errors from assuming
     spherical geometry might be up to 0.55% crossing the equator,
     though generally below 0.3%, depending on latitude and direction
     of travel. An accuracy of better than 3m in 1km is often good
     enough, but if you want greater accuracy, you could use the
     'distVincenty' method for calculating geodesic distances on
     ellipsoids, which gives results accurate to within 1mm.
