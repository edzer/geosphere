_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A 'rhumb line' (or loxodrome) is a path of constant bearing, which
     crosses all meridians at the same angle.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     distRhumb(p1, p2, r=6378137)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      p1: longitude/latitude of point(s) 1; can be a vector of two
          numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude,
          second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object

      p2: as above. Should be of same length of p1, or a single point
          (or vice versa when p1 is a single point

       r: radius of the earth; default = 6378137 m

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Sailors used to (and sometimes still) navigate along rhumb lines
     since it is easier to follow a constant compass bearing than to
     continually adjust the bearing as is needed to follow a great
     circle, though they are normally longer than great-circle
     (orthodrome) routes. Rhumb lines are straight lines on a Mercator
     Projection map. If you maintain a constant bearing along a rhumb
     line, you will gradually spiral in towards one of the poles.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     distance value in units of r (default=meters)
