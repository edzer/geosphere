_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Bearing (direction of travel) along a rhumb line. Unlike a great
     circle, a rhumb line is a line of constant bearing.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     brngRhumb(p1, p2)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      p1: longitude/latitude of point(s); can be a vector of two
          numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude,
          second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object

      p2: as above. Should have same length as p1, or a single point
          (or vice versa when p1 is a single point

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A bearing in degrees
