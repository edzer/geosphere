_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The shortest distance between two points (i.e., the
     'great-circle-distance' or 'as the crow flies'), according to the
     'Vincenty (sphere)' method.  This method assumes a spherical
     earth, ignoring ellipsoidal effects and it is less accurate then
     the 'distVicentyEllipsoid' method.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     distVincentySphere(p1, p2, r=6378137)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      p1: longitude/latitude of point(s) 1; can be a vector of two
          numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude,
          second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object

      p2: as above. Should have same length as p1, or a single point
          (or vice versa when p1 is a single point

       r: radius of the earth; default = 6378137 m

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Distance value in the same unit as 'r' (default is meters)
