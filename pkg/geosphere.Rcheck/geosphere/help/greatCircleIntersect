_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Get the two points where two great cricles cross each other. Great
     circles are defined by two points on it.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     greatCircleIntersect(p1, p2, p3, p4) 

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      p1: Longitude/latitude of a single point; can be a vector of two
          numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude,
          second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object

      p2: As above

      p3: As above

      p4: As above

_V_a_l_u_e:

     two points for each pair of great circles

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

     Robert Hijmans, based on equations by Ed Williams (see reference)
