_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The along track distance is the distance from the start point (p1)
     to the closest point on the path to a third point (p3),  following
     a great circle path defined by points p1 and p2

_U_s_a_g_e:

     alongTrackDistance(p1, p2, p3, r=6378137)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      p1: longitude/latitude of point(s); can be a vector of two
          numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude,
          second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object

      p2: as above. Should have same length as p1, or a single point
          (or vice versa when p1 is a single point

      p3: as above

       r: radius of the earth; default = 6378137m

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A distance in units of r (default is meters)

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:
