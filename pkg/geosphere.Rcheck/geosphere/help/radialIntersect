_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Intersection between two lines defined by their point of origin
     and true bearing

_U_s_a_g_e:

     radialIntersect(p1, brng1, p2, brng2) 

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      p1: Longitude/latitude of point(s); can be a vector of two
          numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude,
          second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object

   brng1: True bearing from p1

      p2: As above. Should have same length as p1, or a single point
          (or vice versa when p1 is a single point

   brng2: True bearing from p2

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a point

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:
