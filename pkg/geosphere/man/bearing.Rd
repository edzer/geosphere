\title{
Bearing
}

\description{
Get the initial bearing (direction to travel in) to go from point1 to point2 following the shortest path (a great circle). Note that bearings change continuously while traveling along a great circle. A route with constant bearing is a rhumb line (see \code{\link[geosphere]{bearingRhumb}}.
}

\usage{
bearing(p1, p2)
}

\arguments{
  \item{p1}{longitude/latitude of point(s), in degrees; can be a vector of two numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude, second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object}
  \item{p2}{as above. Should have same length as p1, or a single point (or vice versa when p1 is a single point}
}


\value{
A bearing in degrees
