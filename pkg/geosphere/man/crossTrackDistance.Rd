\title{
Cross Track Distance
}

\description{
The cross track distance (or cross track error) is the distance of a point from a great-circle path. The great circle path is defined by \code{p1} and \code{p2}, while \code{p3} is the point away from the path.
}

\usage{
crossTrackDistance(p1, p2, p3, r=6378137)
}

\arguments{
  \item{p1}{Start of great circle path. Longitude/latitude of point(s); can be a vector of two numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude, second is latitude) or a spatialPoints* object}
  \item{p2}{End of great circle path. As above. Should have same length as p1, or a single point (or vice versa when p1 is a single point}
  \item{p3}{Point away from the great cricle path. As for p2}
  \item{r}{radius of the earth; default = 6378137}  
}


\value{
A distance in units of \code{r} (default is meters)

The sign indicates which side of the path p3 is on. Positive  means right of the course from p1 to p2, negative means left.
